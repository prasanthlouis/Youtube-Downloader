Youtube-Downloader
==================

Downloads Youtube Videos and Playlists

This is pretty simple and straightforward.

Just copy the link of the youtube video/playlist URL and just run the script.

The script will automatically start downloading the video with the URL you just copied.

You'll have options to pick the best/worst quality. Otherwise a list of options will be displayed so that you can 

pick which resolution you wish to download.

Handy thing about this is that, it downloads pretty fast. I found that downloading with this was much more faster than other 

video downloaders found online.

Note: I don't support downloading copyright videos. I only intend to use this for fun and educational purposes only.
